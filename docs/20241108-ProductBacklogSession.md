3. Planning the dev collaboration session - 
	1. Based on best available times, the team will plan to do a collaboration session on Monday, November 11, 2024 at around 2pm, right after the Sprint Planning session.
	2. Some agenda items for that session include:
		1. GitHub workflow process - check-ins, releases
		2. Definition of Done
		3. Setting up a dummy Next app to walk through set up, features, and how Next works generally
	3. Name our project/team and product
		1. The team suggested and voted to select the project team and product names.
		2. The Product name will be RayVolution
		3. We are now dubbed Radiant Minds
	4.  There were questions from some team members around what user stories and story points are.
		1. Several team members that are familiar with user stories shared information around this concept and provided examples. This made it easier to collaborate and create user stories as we went through the Product Backlog creation session.
	5. Product Backlog creation session
		1. The team walked through the requirements of the application and we collaborated on creating user stories.
		2. It was agreed that any "nice to have" user stories would not be listed as this time and once the MVP was complete, the team could decide if any further user stories should be considered.
		3. It was discussed that the scheduling algorithm may be a bit of a stretch goal and so this will be shelved until the team has made progress against the current list of user stories.
		4. The team decided against having a specific design sprint although possible design tools were discussed such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
		5. The following activities have not yet been taken place:
			1. creating acceptance criteria
			2. prioritizing user stories
			3. estimating story points
			4. breaking down stories into sub-tasks as needed
			5. Definition of Done
			6. Creating a vision statement and product goal
		6. Working agreements - So far this is the only working agreement that we have:
			1. In lieu of the synchronous daily scrum, the team will share updates asynchronously by 4pm each day.
			2. The team is open to pair programming, mobbing, and also independent programming.  The developers will determine their approach based on need and availability.
	6. Sprint Review/Retrospective - 
		1. As this was really a Sprint 0 week, we didn't have anything specific to discuss and showcase for the Sprint Review.
		2. As part of the Sprint Retrospective, we determined that since some team members are not very familiar with Story Points, it would be helpful to share some videos on how Story Points are used.
