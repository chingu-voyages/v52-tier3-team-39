**Project Kickoff:**
* Quick intro including familiarity with Scrum and roles:
In attendance were 8 team members – Chris, Kris, Tim, Jessica, Justin, Aya, Zuzu, and Farrah. The team got familiar with one another and hit it off right away with Farrah, our Primary Scrum Master taking the lead while other team members collaborated to ensure a successful meeting was had.

* Product Owner role – As the team is missing a designated Product Owner, Primary Scrum Master Farrah, suggested if the team can contribute to taking up the task/ role of the P.O and agreement was made on that note to proceed with the idea.

* Project discussion and selection: This was brought up since the Team has a choice to either go with the suggested Project -Solar Panel Planner; or come up with our own creative idea however, given that the requirements and specifications have already been broken down and development team were confident about the given project, the Team stuck with that idea.

* Collaboration tools discussion and selection – 
  * Mural was created to kick off the meeting however, going forward team considered using Jira, GitHub to create the project and have a shared update. Individual email addresses were requested for this purpose. It was agreed that the Our Team section on GitHub be updated with this information.
  * The dev team - NextJS and React were suggested for front end while Node/Mongo/Express for back end. This needs to be revisited for conclusion though.

* Communication preferences discussion – Preferred communication was suggested to be the Discord channel for both chats and voice hub collaboration.

* Confirm GitHub access and familiarity + Updating the My Team section in GitHub – Each team member confirmed having access to the GitHub, expressed level of familiarity as well as reminded those of us yet to complete the Our Team section  - https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v52-tier3-team-39/blob/main/README.md

* Scheduling the Product Backlog Refinement session for this week – Team agreed on PB refinement set for Friday, November 8th 2024 @ 12:00pm. We will also set aside time at the end of this session for Sprint Review and the Sprint Retrospective.
 
* Initial working agreements discussion – Team suggested moving this for next meeting so everyone/most members are present to agree or disagree together and once the tech stack is finalized.
 
* Daily Scrum initial planning – Team agreed to meet 2x a week most convenient for the schedule Wednesdays and Fridays for 1 hour (it may exceed depending on nature of discussion) as well as keep and update of daily task progress/Daily Scrums asynchronously by 4pm on other days of the week.

* Project vision execution – Execution should be carried out as soon as user stories and tasks have been created as the entire Team knows we are on a timeline and need to produce value by end of the sprint.

**To Do's:**
* Chris - will look into MongoDb to see if it's a viable option for us to use
* Zuzu - will create the meeting recap, set up Jira, and share access with the team
